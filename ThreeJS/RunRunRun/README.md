# Run Run Run! ðŸš—

Get behind the wheel and speed through the landscape in a high-stakes chase. Catch the invader and outmaneuver it at every turn.
This 3D car game is built with ThreeJS and CannonJS and will test your car racing skills.

## Game Objective

The player takes control of a car and drives through a landscape, maneuvering past obstacles and collecting fuel before time runs out. The player is presented with two objectives: either chasing an invader or avoiding being caught by it. The ultimate goal is to achieve the highest score possible.

## Development Objective

This project was created to showcase the potential of developing a webpage with a unique experience through 3D navigation, breaking the mold of boring web pages, and to explore cool stuff such as physics and interactive sound.

## Controls

Drive the car with the `WASD` keys.

## Technology

- ThreeJS
- CannonJS
- GLTFLoader
- JQuery
- GSAP
